	- What is the code for installing libraries locally if users don't have admin rights?
	- Can QGIS users install plugins? (usually not an issue, but worth checking)
- Can you access a VM of the computer setup to see how it looks, to update your instructions so people can open QGIS?
- Do users have a "My Documents" or similar place to save files?
- Which operating system do the computers use (name and version)?
- If not using Windows:
	- Can users unzip files?
	- How to they get to the equivalent of My Documents, make new folders, rename files, copy files to a USB stick to take them home?
	- Does the login screen show **** when you type in your password? (If not, explain this to users)

#Logistics:

- How do you get computer logins / passwords?
- Is wifi access available?
